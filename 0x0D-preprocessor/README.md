C Programming: Preprocesors

Preprocessors generally handles directives; include directives, define directives (which includes macros) and comments. Preprocessing is the first step in the compilation process, and it works to replace directives with the actual code / code fragmants needed in the compilation before pushed to the compiler (generates assembly code), then to the assembler (generates object code (machine language) ), & finally the linker (links multiple files and libraries to generate an executable).

This folder explores the preprocessors as dealing with macros in constants and functions-like macros.
